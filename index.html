      <h1>Welcome to TayTay Crochet</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Tay, and this is my corner of the internet where yarn, ideas, and slow
        projects live together. Think of this as a cozy journal, not a polished storefront.

      <h2>Letter from the Author</h2>
      <p>
        Crochet has always been the place my brain goes when the rest of life feels too loud.
        I like slow stitches, long projects, and the kind of making that doesn’t care about
        deadlines. This site is where I keep track of what I’m working on, what I’m thinking
        about, and what I want to try next.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re here, you’re invited to treat this like a quiet room: read a bit, wander
        through the works-in-progress, and maybe leave with an idea you want to try with
        your own hands.

        <h3>On Slow Projects and Not Finishing Things</h3>
        <p>
          Some projects are meant to be finished. Others exist so you always have something
          soft to pick up when your brain is tired. This is about the second kind.

        <h3>Why I Keep Starting New WIPs Anyway</h3>
        <p>
          The guilt of “too many WIPs” is real, but so is the joy of chasing ideas while
          they’re still warm. This is me making peace with both.
