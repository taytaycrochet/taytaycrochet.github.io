        Hi, Friends!
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Taylor and I want to share my crochet creations with you.

      <h2>Letter from the Author</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to grab a hook at a really weird, critical time in my life. Picture a band 
        geek with no band for the first time in almost 10 years; I had absolutely no hobbies 
        whatsoever and if the band geek didn’t tip you off, I had massive perfectionism issues 
        as well. Sure, there were plenty of things that struck some inspiration but, how do you 
        enjoy something when you’re shockingly awful at it? My experiences with most of my 
        interests were “I’ve got so many ideas for this, I’m gonna be so good at it” and then 
        quickly realizing that my vision was not coming to life. I didn’t just want crochet to  
        be different, I actually approached it different.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was really pivotal for me to figure out that I had a problem enjoying things unless I 
        was good at them (I’m hoping by mentioning it, you can identify it in yourself. It’s a 
        total game changer). The next thing I tried, I was determined to come at it as 
        beginner-level as possible to avoid my normal pitfalls. I searched high and low for a 
        tutorial of something that interested me but, seemed doable for an absolute beginner, and 
        then I searched further for something even smaller to try because I wanted to practice to 
        get a feel for what it would be like to hold the yarn in one hand and the hook in the 
        other. Before I went to the store for the materials, I watched YouTube videos of people 
        doing it until I felt the natural desire to try it myself. After the prep work, I got my 
        supplies and gave a chain a try. From there, it was history.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was like finding a new world in yarn and crochet. In that period where I couldn’t find 
        anything I enjoyed and had no hobbies, life was very boring and lonely. I had a hard time 
        relating to people and had an even harder time holding conversations. My relationship 
        with my husband suffered as I leaned on him for entertainment a bit too much. Seeing now, 
        the importance of hobbies in a person’s life, I want to make sure that anyone who’s 
        willing to try crocheting will have a place where they can find free tutorials, project 
        ideas, and product recommendations. Self expression and the community we find through it 
        can make or break a person’s entire life. Allow me to softly nudge you into my loopy, 
        messy world - let’s see what you can create.
